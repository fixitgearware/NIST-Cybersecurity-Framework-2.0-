<h2>Reference Guide in Planning Organizations Risk Management.</h2>

<br>

<h2>Govern</h2>


<br>

GOVERN focuses on the organization's cybersecurity risk management strategy, expectations, and policy are established, communicated, and monitored.<br>

Below is listed the various Sub-categories of the <strong>"Identify"</strong> in planning your organization's risk assessment for its critical infrastructures.

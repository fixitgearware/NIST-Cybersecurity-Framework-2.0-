<h2> THE NIST CSF2.0 A NEW REFERENCE GUIDE IN PLANNING ORGANIZATIONS "RISK ASSESSMENT &amp; RISK MANAGEMENT".</h2>


![](assets/NIST-CF2.0.png)
<br>

The <a href="https://www.fixitgearware.com/cybsec-news/cyber-security/the-nist-cyber-security-framework/2023/09/07/">NIST Cyber Security framework (V1.1)</a>, originated from the United States of America's concern for its national and economic security, which heavily relies on the functioning of critical infrastructures. <br>To ensure the resilience and longevity of these infrastructures, Barack Obama, who was the President of the United States at the time, issued <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/publication/executive-orders-13636-and-13691-privacy-and-civil-liberties-assessment-reports#:~:text=Executive%20Order%2013636%2C%20Improving%20Critical,neutral%20cybersecurity%20framework%2C%20and%20to">Executive Order 13636 (EO) (Executive Orders 13636 and 13691 Privacy and Civil Liberties Assessment Reports)</a>, titled <strong>“Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity”</strong> on February 12th, 2013.<br>


The executive order initiated the voluntary development of a Cybersecurity Framework. This framework offers a <strong>“prioritized, flexible, repeatable, performance-based, and cost-effective approach,”</strong> assisting organizations that use critical infrastructure services in managing cybersecurity risk.
<br>
Ever since this Framework was created, cybersecurity professionals, have used this tool as a guideline in strategizing ways on how its organization manages its cybersecurity risk, and priorortizing cybersecurity as a key component of its organization.

<h2>THE NIST CYBERSECURITY FRAMEWORK 2.0 (NIST CSF2.0)</h2>

In its commitment to ensure Cybersecurity awareness and Risk Management, 11-years and 13-days later, <strong><a href="https://www.nist.gov/">"The National Institute of Standards and Technology. (NIST)"</a></strong>, has instituted a new manual. This new document titled CSF 2.0 (Cybersecurity Framework 2.0), is a modification of the Cybersecurity Framework V1.1, and  was officially released in February 26-2024. 

In the new CSF2.0 drastic changes were implemented, with the introduction of the <strong>“GOVERN”</strong> Function. What does this mean ? Organizations are now able to implement these Functions available in the Cybersecurity Framework  2.0 (CSF 2.0),  in planning their various organizations cybersecurity  risk management strategy, in protecting its critical infrastructures.

<td>GOVERN</td><td> GV </td><td text-align="justify"><ins><strong>The Organization's Cybersecurity Risk Management Strategy,Expectations, and Policy Are Established, Communicated, and Monitored.</strong></ins><br><br>The NIST Function <strong>"GOVERN" </strong> is a new addition to the Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0, designed to emphasize the importance of governance, risk management, and leadership in cybersecurity.<br>
 It provides deliverables, on actions to be taken by an organization, to achieve and prioritize the outcomes of the other five functions(Identify,Detect,Protect,Respond,Recover), regarding its mission, and stakeholders expectations. Governance activities are essential for the incorporation of cybersecurity, into an organization's larger Enterprise Risk Management(ERM) strategy. In addition, it addresses issues regarding the understanding of the organizational context; the establishment of cybersecurity strategy; and cybersecurity supply chain risk management; roles, responsibilities, and authorities; policy; and the oversight of cybersecurity strategy.<br>

The <a href="https://www.fixitgearware.com/cybsec-news/cyber-security/the-nist-cyber-security-framework/2023/09/07/">NIST Cyber Security framework (V1.1)</a>, originated from the United States of America's concern for its national and economic security, which heavily relies on the functioning of critical infrastructures. <br>To ensure the resilience and longevity of these infrastructures, Barack Obama, who was the President of the United States at the time, issued <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/publication/executive-orders-13636-and-13691-privacy-and-civil-liberties-assessment-reports#:~:text=Executive%20Order%2013636%2C%20Improving%20Critical,neutral%20cybersecurity%20framework%2C%20and%20to">Executive Order 13636 (EO) (Executive Orders 13636 and 13691 Privacy and Civil Liberties Assessment Reports)</a>, titled <strong>“Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity”</strong> on February 12th, 2013.<br>

The executive order initiated the voluntary development of a Cybersecurity Framework. This framework offers a <strong>“prioritized, flexible, repeatable, performance-based, and cost-effective approach,”</strong> assisting organizations that use critical infrastructure services in managing cybersecurity risk.
<br>
Ever since this Framework was created, cybersecurity professionals, have used this tool as a guideline in strategizing ways on how its organization manages its cybersecurity risk, and priorortizing cybersecurity as a key component of its organization. 

In its commitment to ensure Cybersecurity awareness and Cybersecurity Risk Management, 11-years and 13-days later, <strong><a href="https://www.nist.gov/">"The National Institute of Standards and Technology. (NIST)"</a></strong>, has instituted a new manual. This new document titled CSF 2.0 (Cybersecurity Framework 2.0), is a modification of the Cybersecurity Framework V1.1, and  was officially released in February 26-2024. 

In the new CSF2.0 drastic changes were implemented, with the introduction of the “GOVERNANCE” Function. What does this mean ? Organizations are now able to implement these Functions available in the Cybersecurity Framework  2.0 (CSF 2.0),  in planning their various organizations cybersecurity  risk management strategy, in protecting its critical infrastructures. 


<h3>THE CSF 2.0  FUNCTIONS UPDATED IN THE RIGHT OTHER ARE:</h3>
<br>
 
<li> <ul>GOVERN (Also known as  GOVERNANCE).</ul></li>

<li><ul>IDENTIFY (Also known as  IDENTIFICATION).</ul></li> 

<li><ul>PROTECT (Also known as PROTECTION).</ul></li> 

<li><ul> DETECT (Also known as DETECTION).</ul></li> 

<li><ul> RESPOND (Also known as RESPONSE).</ul></li> 

<li><ul> RECOVER (Also known as RECOVERY).</ul></li> 

<br><br>

Below is a brief summary of this framework's functions. For a detailed view of the various functions and their applications in planning your organization's risk assessment, please follow the corresponding Github repository link for each function.<br><br>

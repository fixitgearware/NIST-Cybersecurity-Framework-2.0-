<br>

The <a href="https://www.fixitgearware.com/cybsec-news/cyber-security/the-nist-cyber-security-framework/2023/09/07/">NIST Cyber Security framework (V1.1)</a>, originated from the United States of America's concern for its national and economic security, which heavily relies on the functioning of critical infrastructures. <br>To ensure the resilience and longevity of these infrastructures, Barack Obama, who was the President of the United States at the time, issued <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/publication/executive-orders-13636-and-13691-privacy-and-civil-liberties-assessment-reports#:~:text=Executive%20Order%2013636%2C%20Improving%20Critical,neutral%20cybersecurity%20framework%2C%20and%20to">Executive Order 13636 (EO) (Executive Orders 13636 and 13691 Privacy and Civil Liberties Assessment Reports)</a>, titled <strong>“Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity”</strong> on February 12th, 2013.<br>

The executive order initiated the voluntary development of a Cybersecurity Framework. This framework offers a <strong>“prioritized, flexible, repeatable, performance-based, and cost-effective approach,”</strong> assisting organizations that use critical infrastructure services in managing cybersecurity risk.
<br>
Ever since this Framework was created, cybersecurity professionals, have used this tool as a guideline in strategizing ways on how its organization manages its cybersecurity risk, and priorortizing cybersecurity as a key component of its organization. 

In its commitment to ensure Cybersecurity awareness and Cybersecurity Risk Management, 11-years and 13-days later, <strong><a href="https://www.nist.gov/">"The National Institute of Standards and Technology. (NIST)"</a></strong>, has instituted a new manual. This new document titled CSF 2.0 (Cybersecurity Framework 2.0), is a modification of the Cybersecurity Framework V1.1, and  was officially released in February 26-2024. 

In the new CSF2.0 drastic changes were implemented, with the introduction of the “GOVERNANCE” Function. What does this mean ? Organizations are now able to implement these Functions available in the Cybersecurity Framework  2.0 (CSF 2.0),  in planning their various organizations cybersecurity  risk management strategy, in protecting its critical infrastructures. 


<h3>THE CSF 2.0  FUNCTIONS UPDATED IN THE RIGHT OTHER ARE:</h3>

<!-- Here the Govern Function Code Begins.-->

<td>GOVERN</td><td> GV </td><td> The NIST Function <strong>"GOVERN" </strong> is a new addition to the Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0, designed to emphasize the importance of governance, risk management, and leadership in cybersecurity.<br>
 It represents a strategic pivot in the framework, acknowledging the critical role of organizational context, cybersecurity risk management, and oversight in managing cybersecurity risks effectively. This function aims in eliminating the obscurity and bring to a clear understanding on accountability. It consist of categories such as the "Organizational Context", which constantly focuses on having a clear understanding and continuously accessing its cybersecurity posture, by which the organization conducts its businesses.

 This function provides a deep understanding of the organization's business environment and the risks involved. Consequently, it enables the organization to devise a well-structured action plan and prioritize its efforts in line with its risk management strategy and business requirements. </td><td>&#x2022; Asset Management <br><strong>(ID.AM)</strong><br><br> &#x2022; Risk Assessment<br><strong>(ID.RA)</strong><br><br> &#x2022; Improvement<br><strong>(ID.IM)</strong><br></td><td>&#x2022; <strong>Website :</strong><br><a href="https://www.fixitgearware.com/cybsec-news/cyber-security/the-nist-framework-cheatsheet-for-identify/2023/09/11/" target="_blank">Identify Function.</a><br><br>&#x2022; <strong>GitHub<br>:</strong><a href="https://github.com/fixitgearware/NIST-CYBERSECURITY-FRAMEWORK-V1.1/blob/main/README.md" target="_blank">Repository</a><td>&#x2022;Business Environment<br>&#x2022;<strong>ID.BE</strong><br><br><br>&#x2022; <strong>GitHub<br>:</strong><a href="https://github.com/fixitgearware/NIST-CYBERSECURITY-FRAMEWORK-V1.1/blob/main/README.md" target="_blank">Repository</a></td><td>&#x2022;<strong>NIL</strong><br></td>

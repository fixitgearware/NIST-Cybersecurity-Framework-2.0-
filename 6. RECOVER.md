<h2>TABLE DESCRIPTION:</h2>
<br>
 
<li><ul><strong><ins>ID:</ins></strong><br>This column contains the ID of the category being described and its connection with that particular function. e.g. Function:&nbsp;'ID' points to the category "AM (Asset Management)", leading to the ID of that category being "ID.AM".</ul></li><br>

<li><ul><strong><ins>CATEGORY:</ins></strong><br>This column describes the key focus of the organization in that particular category. e.g. For the category 'ID.AM', "Asset Management"  is the key area of focus.</ul></li><br> 

<li><ul><strong><ins>METHODOLOGY:</ins></strong><br>Describes the methods and considerations the organization should carry out its risk assessment pertinet to the category being considered. e.g ID.AM describes the list of assets to be identified.</ul></li><br>

<li><ul><strong><ins>SUB CATEGORY ID:</ins></strong><br>List the various sub-categories related to that specific category. e.g ID.AM (category) --> ID.AM-1, ID.AM-2, ID.AM-3, ID.AM-4, ID.AM-5, ID.AM-7, ID.AM-8(Sub-Category).</ul></li><br>

<li><ul><strong><ins>SUB CATEGORY DESCRIPTION:</ins></strong><br>This column describes each sub-category 'ID' e.g. ID.AM-1 has its own description, which is different from ID.AM-2.</ul></li><br>

<li><ul><strong><ins>SUB CATEGORY MODIFICATIONS:</ins></strong><br>This column, contains the sub-category that "WITHDRAWN", The sub category, that was "NEWLY ADDED OR INTRODUCED" and where the withdrawn category was "MOVED TO".</ul></li><br>

<br>
 
<li><ul><strong><ins>ID:</ins></strong><br>This column contains the ID of the category being described and its connection with that particular function. e.g. Function:&nbsp;'RC' points to the category "RP (Incident Recovery Plan Execution)", leading to the ID of that category being "RC.RP".</ul></li><br>

<li><ul><strong><ins>CATEGORY:</ins></strong><br>This column describes the key focus of the organization in that particular category. e.g. For the category 'RC.RP', "Incident Recovery Plan Execution"  is the key area of focus.</ul></li><br> 

<li><ul><strong><ins>METHODOLOGY:</ins></strong><br>Describes the methods and considerations the organization should carry out its risk assessment pertinet to the category being considered. e.g RC.RP describes the timely restoration of services.</ul></li><br>

<li><ul><strong><ins>SUB CATEGORY ID:</ins></strong><br>List the various sub-categories related to that specific category. e.g RC.RP (category) --> RC.RP-1, RC.RP-2, RC.RP-3, RC.RP-4, RC.RP-5, RC.RP-6 (Sub-Category).</ul></li><br>

<li><ul><strong><ins>SUB CATEGORY DESCRIPTION:</ins></strong><br>This column describes each sub-category 'ID' e.g. RC.RP-1 has its own description, which is different from RC.RP-2.</ul></li><br>

RECOVER function focuses on the need to put inplace and execute essential activities that maintain resilience, and restore business operations, affected by the cybersecurity incident.<br>

Below is listed the various Sub-categories of the <strong>"Identify Function"</strong> in planning your organization's risk assessment for its critical infrastructures.
